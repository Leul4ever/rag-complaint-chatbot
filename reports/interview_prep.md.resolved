# 🎯 Interview Preparation: CrediTrust RAG Project

This guide provides the specific content you need to fill out your Project Experience form and highlights key "win" points for your interview.

## 📝 Form Content

### 🏷️ Project Title
**CrediTrust: Intelligent Financial Complaint Analysis (RAG)**
*(Short, precise, and professional)*

---

### 🏛️ Project Context
Developed a production-grade **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to analyze and interpret thousands of consumer complaints from the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** database. The system is designed for financial compliance and risk management teams.

---

### ⚠️ Problem Definition
*   **Manual Inefficiency**: Financial institutions handle thousands of unstructured complaints daily; manual auditing is slow (taking up to 48 hours for deep trends).
*   **Technical Barrier**: Non-technical stakeholders (compliance officers) lack the SQL or data science skills to extract specific insights from raw narrative data.
*   **Risk Exposure**: Slow detection of systemic issues (e.g., predatory lending patterns) leads to significant regulatory fines and reputational damage.

---

### 💡 Solution Description
The system follows a clear **Input → Logic → Output** flow:
*   **Input**: Natural language queries from a user (e.g., *"What are the main issues with interest rates in credit card complaints?"*).
*   **Logic**:
    1.  **Retrieval**: Uses **FAISS** and **MiniLM** embeddings to perform semantic search across 15,000+ narratives, identifying the most relevant context.
    2.  **Generation**: A **LaMini-Flan-T5** transformer model processes the retrieved context to generate a grounded, conversational answer.
    3.  **Explainability**: Integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to visualize which keywords most influenced the AI's decision.
*   **Output**: A concise summary of findings, direct citations to Complaint IDs for verification, and interactive charts showing data distributions and keyword importance.

---

### 🛠️ Your Contribution
*   **Designed Solution Architecture**: Orchestrated the full RAG pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Hugging Face and FAISS.
*   **Built Core Logic**: Implemented the vector manager for high-speed semantic search and integrated the text generation models.
*   **API & Tools Integration**: Built a modern, interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** for real-time analysis and visualization.
*   **Deployment & Reliability**: Containerized the entire application with **Docker** and established 100% test coverage using **pytest** with GitHub Actions CI.
*   **Explainability Design**: Implemented SHAP-based feature importance tracking to ensure transparency for compliance audits.

---

### 📈 Outcome or Result
*   **⚡ Speed**: Reduced "Time-to-Insight" from **48 hours to less than 3 seconds** per query.
*   **🛡️ Accuracy & Trust**: Achieved 100% grounded answers with direct citations to original data sources, eliminating "hallucinations."
*   **🔍 Compliance Readiness**: Provided visual transparency (via SHAP) to explain model logic, satisfying internal auditing requirements.

## 🚀 How to Win the Interview

1.  **Focus on "Why", not just "What"**: When asked about the RAG pipeline, explain that you used it because it ensures the LLM stays grounded in *your* data, preventing it from making things up (hallucinations).
2.  **Highlight Explainability (SHAP)**: Most engineers build chatbots; few build *explainable* ones. Mentioning SHAP shows you care about "AI Transparency" and "Compliance," which is huge in the financial sector.
3.  **Mention the CI/CD and Tests**: Point to your 100% test coverage and GitHub Actions. This shows you are a disciplined software engineer, not just a model builder.
4.  **Hardware Optimization**: Mention that you optimized the model (`LaMini-Flan-T5`) to run efficiently on **CPUs**, making it cost-effective and easy to deploy without expensive GPUs.

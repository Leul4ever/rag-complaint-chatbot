My interpretation of what was told to me is if I had over four hundered dollars in my savings and kept over 1,500 hundered in my checking my accounts would not be charged. If you look in my checking account, I always had more than that and had my direct deposits sent in there as well. As for my savings, I never touched it. I thought my saving would be getting interest. Isn't that what a savings account is supposed to do? This past XXXX in my statement I saw that my savings was at a zero. Come to find out BB & T has been charging my account a maintanence fee as well as a inactive fee, eventhough my paychecks have been going into my checking account and I have been having automatic drafts out of my account and writing checks to vendors. When I confronted my branch about it, I was told that it was my responsibility to keep up with my account. They said they will look into though and try to get my funds back ; however, after two weeks the branch manager called me and told me that he did everything possible but the bank will not refund me my funds and said sorry.

            "Greetings, My wife and I for well over a decade have had several accounts with PNC ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) bank. We have our mortgage with them, as well as a home equity loan, a Visa Credit card, and my wife has her checking account there into which her pay check is deposited. I also have currently what is known as their \" Virtual Wallet '' savings account which is attached to a debit card. To put it mildly, PNC makes a good amount of money from our household with interest charges for the past decade. And we pay our bills on time. \n\nHere is the problem I am having. A few years ago, I had a standard savings account with PNC which is attached to a debit card. I am un employed, so the balance for my personal account was always low, usually under XXXX dollars at any given time. I mainly used that account for basic household items. A few years back, PNC started charging a monthly service fee for savings accounts that had less than a {$500.00} dollar a month average daily balance. \n\nWhen they started doing that a few years ago, I called PNC to complain, and a PNC customer service representative suggested that I close that account, and open up what PNC calls a \" Virtual Wallet '' account, which was a new program. She said that if I did that, there would be no service fees, because PNC saves money with the \" Virtual Wallet '' accounts, since they are paperless, and no hard copies are mailed to me on a monthly basis. She said the reason why PNC created the \" Virtual Wallet '' accounts, was for folks like me who did not have much money and can not afford these fees. So I said GREAT! I closed my account, and opened up the virtual wallet account and everything was good. No more service fees on the new Virtual Wallet account. And I did not care about not getting any more paper statements because the balance was so low anyway, and I was able to electronically download the statements from their web site if I needed any. \n\nThe problem now, is that PNC has gone back on their word. Last month, they started charging a {$7.00} monthly service fee, on the new \" Virtual Wallet '' accounts! Yesterday, I received a {$7.00} charge. So for the past two months, I had {$7.00} service fees billed to that account. The most recent XXXX dollar fee brought my savings account into a negative balance. \n\nI called PNC to complain about this. To PNC 's credit, the customer service rep did refund the two {$7.00} service fees. HOWEVER, when I asked her if she could please stop charging the account the monthly fee from now on, she said she can not grant that request, because the customer service representative told me that this was a final decision made by PNC management several months ago, that it would be highly unlikely that PNC reversed their policy on this, and that if my balance on that account ever falls below XXXX dollars a month, I would still be charged that XXXX dollar fee from now on. \n\nThe Customer service rep did acknowledge that the Virtual Wallet Accounts used to have no service charge, but that has changed, and management decided to also add service fees to the Virtual Wallet accounts. So I asked her what is the point of the Virtual Wallet accounts? They after all were created to offer no charge savings accounts. No answer on that. \n\nIt seems like they are taking advantage of people who have low or no income. I also asked the PNC representative if they could make exceptions for folks like us, who have several accounts with PNC. She also said no. \n\nSo the PNC Customer Service rep asked me if I wanted to file a complaint and I said yes. So she filed the complaint, issued me a complaint number for the complaint about the above as described. I asked her if I would receive a letter as to the decision, and she said no. She also suggested to me that even though she is filing the complaint for me, it will be a waste of time, because she seriously doubted management would make a policy change. \n\nThank you for your consideration.",

I have done two writings at your website and officially writing this letter hoping to hear from someone since to make matters worse there is no avenue for meeting to speak to a person in higher management or director of money gram face-to-face in Maryland where i live since the headquarters of Money gram is in Minneapolis. \nI have called customer service multiple times and all i have gotten is we will have to investigate and get back to you and may take several months. \nFor your information in addition to this, i am sending a formal complaint in writing also to consumer rights, consumer financial protection bureau and Maryland XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \nThese bad experiences should stop and no other consumer should be made to experience this type of behavior from money gram or any other such financial establishments who promise to transfer securely and safely money paid to them to a designated receiver at a fee. \nHow can such a promise made by money gram to consumers not kept and money gram not held accountable but rather put the responsibility on the consumer who trusted money gram for its promise of safe and secure transfers. This in itself can imply defrauding of consumers by money gram even if that is not what money gram intends because come to find out i realize there is no measures or system in place by which Money Gram is able to monitor and account for every phase of money transfer transactions up to its point of delivery such that Money Gram is able to tell exactly where and who or which agent or representative disbursed the money transferred and documents showing proof of the identity of the receiver which can be traced to. \nI feel defrauded by Money Gram even if that is not their intention. This is the experience i just had transferring money using the services of Money Gram. On Saturday XX/XX/2020 i paid {$500.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to money gram for transfer to a relative  in XXXX. This was one of the few occasions i have had to send money using money gram and the receiver who is a close relative of mine has been able to receive money transferred using money gram in the past with no problems. So as always i sent him the reference number and he went with his ID and details required to money gram agent in XXXX to try and get the money transferred but since Monday XX/XX/2020 he has kept going and always being told by the money gram agents in XXXX they can not complete the transaction and are unable to access the money so can not pay money to him. As i write today XX/XX/2020, the money has still not been paid to my relative who is the designated receiver. The money gram financial institution or agent in XXXX advised my designated receiver that there must be a problem with the transaction and the problem must be from Money Gram in USA and he should have the sender contact Money Gram USA and  have transaction canceled and resent. \nThis is where i get very angry, upset and feel defrauded by money gram. i called money gram customer service ( XXXX ) right away and have been calling since Monday XX/XX/2020 to make them aware of the problem with the transaction and made them aware the designated receiver has not been able to receive the money ( {$500.00} ) i paid to money gram. They got the reference number of the transaction and came back to tell me the system shows the money has been received. This is where there exists a problem. Because it is a fact that my designated receiver has not been able to receive the money i sent through money gram and money gram on the other hand is telling me the money has been received. \nI smell fraud here and i know in today 's world, hacking, identity theft etc can occur and for that reason there should be a system in place to safe guard money transfers and the onus is on money gram Payment systems Inc who have taken on the task as a business to provide such a service at a fee with the promise of safe and secure money transfers. Also, who is the onus on to proof that the money has been sent to the designated receiver. The onus is on money gram and money gram should be able to show when, where, which money gram agent disbursed the money and show documentation of the identity of the person the money was paid to. \nUp to today XXXX with all the calls made to customer service Money Gram, they have not been able to confirm exactly where in XXXX If money really got to XXXX, which money gram agent disbursed the money and show documentation of the identity of the person the money was paid to. All they keep telling me is the money has been received. \nThat can mean anything. Any ones guess could be as good as my guess. Possibilities could include ; Money accessed along the way at any point of the transfer and being documented as has been received. \nThis is not acceptable and a failure of the money gram system and promise. I think consumers deserve a better service than this and money gram may have to stop promising safe and secure money transfers since that seems not to be always true and consumers and the public should be made aware of this risk and failure of the system and not count on any safe and secure transfers by money gram. \nI am going to make this a mission of mine because i will not want anybody else to go through this type of experience. \nAlso just as banks, credit card companies, etc, who take peoples monies for business, guarantee to consumers to be responsible for any liabilities associated with failures of their system, Money Gram Payment systems Inc should be responsible for monies paid to  them to transfer which do not get to the designated receiver period. If Money gram claim money has been received as I am being told, the onus is on Money Gram to show documentation of proof of the ID of receiver and exact money gram place and Money Gram agent money was disbursed otherwise Money gram should refund the money no matter what. \nThat assurance is needed to foster consumer trust in Money gram and also will make money gram make sure it has a system that is truly safe and secure. Otherwise, Money gram will be taking consumers for granted and for a ride. \nThis is the exact thing I am experiencing right now and do expect a quick attention to my case and a full refund of my money of {$500.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) without fail. \nThank you for your cooperation and quick attention to this very serious matter Sincerely, XXXX XXXX Cell # : XXXX Cc : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Maryland XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",

Despite repeated inquiries, the representatives at Santander failed to explain crucial aspects, such as interest rates, hidden fees, and early payoff penalties that was not in my initial contract upon taking out a personal loan of {$25000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told there is a {$0.00} I will have to pay to close out this loan and also was told that the same goes for credit card accounts, which doesn't make sense Improper Billing and Payment Handling : I have experienced numerous instances where Santander improperly applied interest payments, even though payments were made on time and in full to close the loan on XX/XX/XXXX. When I contacted customer service to resolve these issues, they were unhelpful and dismissive, failing to rectify the mistakes after I told them my contract stated there is no penalties for paying off the loan in full early. \n\nUnjustified Account Fees : I have been charged excessive and unwarranted fees that were never disclosed to me when I opened my account. These fees were applied in a manner that contradicts the terms initially agreed upon. As of XX/XX/XXXX the loan amount was {$22000.00} was the reflecting balance and a payment in the said amount was made on XX/XX/XXXX to close out the loan. withing 20 days after the full payment was made Santander started charging additional interest of {$220.00} instead of closing the loan, I was told by a representative that they took out XXXX payment which was not due in XXXX when they received XXXX payments. \n\nFailure to Provide Accurate Account Information : Despite requesting detailed statements and records to clarify the confusion around fees and payments, Santander failed to provide transparent or accurate information. The customer service agents consistently gave conflicting responses, making it difficult to resolve my concerns. \n\nImpact on Me : These deceptive practices have not only caused me financial strain but also significant stress and frustration.

            "I have been a Bank of America credit card customer for 10+ years. My credit card has been unused for the past few years ( {$0.00} balance ). After receiving innumerable marketing letters and emails, one caught my eye. The offer was to \" upgrade '' my card to a new \" Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card '' with a promotional interest rate of 0 % on all new purchases until XX/XX/XXXX, a rewards program offering 1.5 % cash back on all purchases, and a {$200.00} cash back bonus after making {$1000.00} in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening. \n\nAs I had a few large purchases to make, I thought this seemed like an excellent opportunity. So, I completed my card upgrade on or around XX/XX/XXXX. The process ended with a confirmation screen informing me of the successful upgrade. My new card would arrive in the mail in a few weeks, and I was encouraged to start making purchases immediately because my account number would not change, and everything would transfer to my new card. \n\nI waited a few days, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I began to purchase the goods I had in mind, assuming that as I had successfully upgraded my account, I would receive the new promotional rate and the appropriate cash back bonus. Accordingly, I made XXXX purchases on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$5000.00} that first billing cycle. \n\nWhen I reviewed my account statement on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that I had only received cashback rewards for the purchase made on XX/XX/XXXX. I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX, and after being transferred repeatedly and explaining the situation to several reps, I spoke to an agent in the rewards department who understood why my other purchases had not been credited and assured me that he would take steps to revise my rewards account. The company did adjust my cashback credit on XX/XX/XXXX to include the purchases made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They also awarded the {$200.00} bonus for {$1000.00} in purchases on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI continued to use the card for new purchases believing that I was receiving a 0 % interest rate. When I received my card statement in XXXX, I was flummoxed to notice accumulating interest. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called customer service and was shuffled from rep to rep until someone seemed to understand the problem. After nearly an hour, I spoke to an agent that I believe worked in the promotional department. He informed me that the purchases made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were not classified under the promotional rate and were accumulating interest at the standard rate. In our conversation, he informed me that even though I had upgraded the card on XX/XX/XXXX and was encouraged to start purchasing immediately, in the fine print of my account disclosure, the promotional rate did not begin until XX/XX/XXXX. I was shocked and expressed concern about having been deceived by a company I trusted. He understood that I felt tricked and agreed with me that this was inappropriate. He took copious notes that he read back to me and had me record a statement confirming. He assured me that I would receive written documentation regarding the situation in the mail in 10 days. I left the call feeling satisfied that the agent had rectified the problem, just as the previous agent had rectified the problem with the cash rewards in XXXX. \n\nAfter not receiving any documentation, I called customer service again on XXXX and went from rep to rep for XXXX minutes. The final agent I spoke with that day informed me that the company had transferred {$4000.00} to the promotional rate on XX/XX/XXXX. I protested that I still had interest charges on my account and requested that he remove them. I again explained how I felt deceived by the company. He offered to remove the current month 's interest charge, {$70.00}. He told me that he was unable to do better. I explained that I did not believe this was appropriate. \n\nToday, XX/XX/XXXX, there is {$660.00} that Bank of America has incorrectly classified under the standard interest rate. As a result, there are also {$220.00} in interest charges that the bank needs to refund.",
